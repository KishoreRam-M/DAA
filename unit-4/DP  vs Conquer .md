# üîÅ Dynamic Programming vs Divide-and-Conquer

## üß© What They Have in Common

| **Aspect**               | **Dynamic Programming (DP)**                                    | **Divide-and-Conquer (D\&C)**                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Problem Division**     | Breaks problem into smaller subproblems                         | Breaks problem into smaller subproblems          |
| **Recursive Approach**   | Solves subproblems recursively                                  | Solves subproblems recursively                   |
| **Optimal Substructure** | Uses solutions of subproblems to build optimal overall solution | Same ‚Äî solves and combines subproblems optimally |
| **Subproblem Overlap**   | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî stores and reuses overlapping subproblem results        | ‚ùå No ‚Äî subproblems are usually independent       |

### üîë Key Difference:

* **DP** solves **overlapping** subproblems and **reuses** results.
* **D\&C** solves **independent** subproblems and **does not reuse** results.

# üß† Characteristics of Dynamic Programming

| **Characteristic**          | **Description**                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Optimal Substructure**    | Solution to the main problem is built from optimal solutions to subproblems |
| **Overlapping Subproblems** | Same subproblems occur multiple times and are reused                        |
| **Memoization**             | Top-down approach: store computed subproblem results to avoid recomputation |
| **Tabulation**              | Bottom-up approach: solve small subproblems first and build up the solution |
| **Optimal Solution**        | Guarantees the best solution by exploring all possibilities                 |
| **State Space**             | Problem can be represented using states, each corresponding to a subproblem |

# üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Design a Dynamic Programming Solution

1. **Characterize the Structure**

   * Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
   * Find how their solutions can form the final result.

2. **Define the State**

   * Choose a state that captures essential information needed for subproblems.

3. **Formulate the Recurrence**

   * Write a recursive formula that relates the current state to smaller subproblems.

4. **Determine Base Cases**

   * Define trivial or smallest inputs with known answers.

5. **Choose Memoization or Tabulation**

   * **Memoization**: Recursively compute with caching (Top-down).
   * **Tabulation**: Iteratively fill a table (Bottom-up).

6. **Compute the Solution**

   * Use the recurrence and state transitions to compute the final result.
